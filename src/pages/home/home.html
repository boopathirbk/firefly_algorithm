  <p>What is Firefly Algorithm</p>
  <p> 1. The Firefly Algorithm is a computationally efficient, nature-inspired, population-based metaheuristic that derives its solution approach based upon the characteristics of fireflies. Learn more in: A Nature-Inspired Metaheuristic Approach for Generating Alternatives</p>
  <p>2. The Firefly Algorithm is a computationally efficient, biologically-inspired, population-based metaheuristic that derives its solution approach based upon the characteristics of fireflies. Learn more in: Bio-Inspired Modelling to Generate Alternatives</p>
  <p>3. Population based meta-heuristic method which is inspired from flashing light behaviour of fireflies in nature. Learn more in: Population-Based vs. Single Point Search Meta-Heuristics for a PID Controller Tuning</p>
  <p>4. An algorithm that simulates the luminescence properties of fireflies based on the group search. Learn more in: Swarm Intelligent Optimization Algorithms and Its Application in Mobile Robot Path Planning </p>
